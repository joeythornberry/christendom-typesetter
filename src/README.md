This project may become open source in the future, but at the moment it is unlicensed, meaning "no one may reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works" from it. If you want to join this project as a collaborator, email me at lewis.thornberry@christendom.edu. (Of course, MikTeX, the project Cdomtex uses to compile LaTeX to PDF, is completely open source, and I claim no rights to it.)
