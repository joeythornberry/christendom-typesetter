		Each paper that uses Christendom Typesetter
		must have its own directory (file folder). Create one or more .txt
		files in that directory, and you can use Christendom Typesetter
		to combine them into a paper. (The button above can also create a
		directory if you don't already have one.)

		Click the button above to open the live preview, and

		compile your paper into a PDF.

		<sup>1</sup>You don't use this program to actually write your paper -
		it just makes it look nice. You can use any text editor you want.
		</p>
		<p>Microsoft Word and Google Docs are not text editors - 
		they are word processors, and this program is designed
		to replace them. Use Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Mac) instead.
		I use Neovim.
