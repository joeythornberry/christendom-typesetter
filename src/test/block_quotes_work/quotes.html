Let me not to the marriage of true minds
Admit impediments. Love is not love
Which alters when it alteration finds
Or bends with the remover to remove.
<q style="white-space: pre-line">
Nay, love is an ever-fixed mark
That looks on tempests and is never shaken.
It is the star to every wandering bark,
Whose worths' unknown, although his height be ta'en.
</q>
Love's not time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
<q>Within his bending sickle's compass come.
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks
But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
If this be error, and against me proved,</q>
I never wrote, nor no man ever loved.
