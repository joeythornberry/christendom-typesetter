Let me not to the marriage of true minds
Admit impediments. Love is not love
Which alters when it alteration finds
Or bends with the remover to remove.
\Q{
\newline\indent Nay, love is an ever-fixed mark
\newline\indent That looks on tempests and is never shaken.
\newline\indent It is the star to every wandering bark,
\newline\indent Whose worths' unknown, although his height be ta'en.
\newline\indent }
Love's not time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
\Q{Within his bending sickle's compass come.
\newline\indent Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks
\newline\indent But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
\newline\indent If this be error, and against me proved,}
I never wrote, nor no man ever loved.
